While making their way through the forest at night, one of the crew members is attacked by a large green parrot-like bird. The bird seems to have mistaken the crew member for a possible mate, probably due to his green cap. The loud screeching and booming calls are heard across the forest, with the man seeming in quite a bit of pain and disarray.\n\nOne of the guides informs you that the bird is prized by locals for its delicious meat and warm coat.

And, before anyone could tell them, your crew, hungry for meat, loosed the boats from their moorings, and wielding harpoons went for the hunt.\n\nFailing many times to target and separate the small calves in the herde. It took an entire day for your crew to slay the large bull,who was 9 meters in length, and the strength of a couple men. Its thick blubber proved too resilient for our ships harpoons, and your crew had to pin it down, waiting for eb to arrive to beach the animal before they could finally deliver the killing blow. \n\nThe red tough meat tastes of corned beef, and is slow to spoil.

It has been long understood by our other advisors that this man has an adventurous spirit, some might call it a “death wish”. Even so, after long deliberation we decided to let this man set out, even if it was only to be rid of his squabbles.\n\nOn his journey through these American jungles it was then that this painter encountered a beast that enamoured him to the depths of his whimsical soul. His journal reads as follows:\n\n “Look at his little spots, those tufted ears. The animal has the most wonderful tangle of stripes, bars, chains, spots, dots smudges … which look as though they were put on as the animal ran by. This animal seems to be adored by Europeans and locals alike. And, it seems, that one of them on our journey has gotten brazen as he seemingly has no issue with being fed the from the hands of men … The captain has ordered us not to interact with the animal, for our supplies are precious. But, I can not comply … as such, I named him Babou.“\n\nThe painter has been caught smuggling his “pet” onto our ship after our last expedition.

And, while less is being stolen, a person can only stay awake for so many hours before some shut-eye is needed. This whole endeavor has impeded our ability to properly navigate the terrain, and the morale in the camp is at a breaking point.\n\nA few days later, one of the soldiers spotted an orange shimmer among the supplies. Expecting to catch the thief in the act, he rushes onwards only to stumble and fall at his encounter with the suspect. Before him is gathered a pack of golden maned monkey meticulously scavenging through the camp’s supplies, which at the sight of the soldier scurry away deep into the forest. On the soldier’s immediate report on the occurrence he’s flogged by our conquistador for his blatant attempt at lying.\n\nA few days later the monkeys are once again spotted, this time during communal dinner time under the view of the entire company.

And a few weeks later again, our naturalist with four companions went ashore to make an excursion. Our captain writes: “After a march of many miles they discovered four similar animals, of which two were chased by the greyhounds of our naturalist. The animals escaped by leaps and bounds in the thick, tall grass, not to be seen again. These creatures do not walk on four legs, but jump like a jumping mouse on their hind legs quickly forward. When we asked the locals they replied with the word ‘Kangaroo’. Such a fascinating beast.”\n\nOn further observation, though, the kangaroo got its name from a confusion of tongues. In an attempt by the explorers to inquire how these creatures were called. The Aborigines gave the answer “kangaroo” meaning “I do not understand you”.

While they did share the island with giant eagles (Haast’s Eagles) which too preyed on the Mao birds,  they didn’t pose a threat to their earlier ancestors that hunted down the Moa with spears and traps.\n\nIt has been some time since Moa have been sighted around the village and the time of Moa Hunters is long gone. All villages in the vicinity now get their nourishment from farming and fishing. Some moved further inland, chasing the Moa.

The clever beaver was aware of the desirability of these organs, and had a strategy to ensure his escape. If he found himself pursued by hunters and was unable to get away, the beaver would bite off his own testicles and throw them into the hunter's path. With no further motivation for pursuit, the hunter would give up and the beaver live to see another day.”\n\n“This ploy could only work once. What if the beaver found himself pursued a second time? On that occasion, he would stop and roll over, showing his pursuer that he no longer had the prize so ardently sought. The disappointed hunter would abandon the chase, again allowing the beaver to live.”\n\nWhile this story is more fiction than fact, it is an undeniable fact that the beavers that called our rivers their home in plentiful numbers just a few hundred years ago, are now a rare sight to behold. With our foresters estimating numbers to be in the dozens. While the hunting of beavers for their fur has long been outlawed, many still hun them for their castoreum, a secretion of its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties.\n\nBut, with our rediscovery of the classics, we might have found a more easily cultivated substitute for the scarce castoreum; Ricinus, or more commonly known as “castor beans”. The naturalist Pliny the Elder cited the poisonous qualities of the seeds, but mentioned that they could be used to form wicks for oil lamps (possibly if crushed together), and the oil as a laxative and lamp oil. \n\nMaybe it’s time to reintroduce the beaver in our tributary regions, to combat the decline in our fish populations."

It has been suggested that the Komodo dragon is the real-life origin of all our dragon myths, and it is certainly plausible that Chinese sailors would have brought back awestruck tales of them. The local tale of the lizard goes as follows:\n\n“On Komodo Island lived a beautiful princess, called by the people ‘The Dragon Princess’. The Princess marries and gives birth to twins, one is a human boy called Gerong and the second is a female dragon, named Ora. Gerong took residence with the humans in the village and Ora turned to the forest. Years passed and the twins grew into adults. One day, Gerong set out to hunt deer. He was successful and caught the deer and set about collecting it to take back to the people of the village. Suddenly, out of nowhere, appeared a large Komodo dragon which began feasting on the deer. Gerong tried to scare the dragon away, but it did not move, so he took out his bow and arrow and took aim. Suddenly there was a bright flash of light and a beautiful woman appeared. It was his mother, The Dragon Princess. “Do not kill her,” The Dragon Princess implored. “That is your twin sister, Ora.” Gerong put down his weapon and left the dragon in peace. From that point onwards, the people of Komodo Island lived harmoniously with the dragons and would not hunt or hurt them. The dragons could hunt freely on the island and when they were injured, their human brothers would come to their aid.”"

A beast first introduced by Julius Caesar who appropriately named it “Cameleopard”. This extraordinary animal is like a camel in all respects except that its legs are not all of the same length, the hind legs being the shorter. Beginning from the rump it grows gradually higher, which gives it the appearance of mounting some elevation; and towering high aloft, it supports the rest of its body on its front legs and lifts its neck in turn to an unusual height.

 flora_and_fauna.34.t:0 "Goddess of the Yangtze"
  flora_and_fauna.34.d:0 "Per Chinese folklore, a beautiful young girl is said to have lived with her stepfather on the banks of the river Yangtze. He was evil, and a greedy man out for his own self-interest. One day, he took the girl on a boat, intending to sell her on the market. Out on the river, though, he became infatuated with her beauty and tried to take advantage of her. But she freed herself by plunging into the river whereupon a big storm came and sank the boat. After the storm had thus settled, people saw a beautiful dolphin swimming – the incarnation of the girl – which became known as the ‘Goddess of the Yangtze.’ The baiji, in the region of Yangtze, is regarded as a symbol of peace and prosperity."

  flora_and_fauna.39.d:0 "I recollected that her eye excelled in brightness, that of any other animal, and that she has no eyelids — She may therefore be esteemed an emblem of vigilance. — She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders: She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage. — As if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her, she conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be a most defenseless animal; and even when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense, they appear weak and contemptible; but their wounds however small, are decisive and fatal: — Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of stepping on her. — Was I wrong, Sir, in thinking this a strong picture of the temper and conduct of America?\n\n- attributed to Benjamin Franklin"

  flora_and_fauna.40.d:0 "Condors are considered sacred animals by us and our neighbours, and tales of its preeminence have been told from California to the great Andean plateau high up above. According to the origin mythology of the Wiyot Indians, the Condor was the ancestor of their tribes. Other Californian tribes believe condors have healing powers, and Californian Indian doctors frequently use condor feathers as part of their traditional medicine ceremonies. In the Quechua and Aymara cultures of South America, the Condor is a symbol of the sky, and is frequently represented in tribal art. The Mapuche people call Condor the King of Birds, and believe he embodies the four cardinal virtues of wisdom, justice, goodness, and leadership. While the Wiyot tribe of California say that the condor recreated mankind after “Above Old Man” wiped humanity out with a flood.\n\nHowever, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood so that it would flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire. \n\nHow will we define our rites?"

  flora_and_fauna.41.d:0 "Now that we’ve established a firm grasp on the fertile lands along the Rio Sao Francisco it is time to start preparing the land to support the further growth of our colony’s economy.\n\nOur colonial governor wants to pursue a policy of intensive burning, logging and using the land to raise our cattle. Such policies have worked in the neighbouring region of Bahia, but some fear that the dry climate of Sao Francisco might not be suitable for such an extreme undertaking. Instead, the local government request monetary support to dig irrigation so they can support a wider array of crops. Also, it would leave most the caatinga, the desiccant landscape removed from the river, untouched. A move that would still allow locals to forage and wildlife to fare well. Which, might prove profitable in the long run, as the region is home to an azure blue species of Macaw."
