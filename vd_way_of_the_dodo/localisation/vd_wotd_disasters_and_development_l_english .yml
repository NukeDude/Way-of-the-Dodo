  disasters_and_development.1.d:0 "It has been 100 years since Zheng He has led the seven expeditions towards the “Western” or Indian ocean. These expeditions, together with the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress in 1449, marked a turning point of China on the world stage and ushered in an era of outward influence and expansion.\n\nOur court officials, having becoming rich of the tributary fleets from the south, propose that our emperor Zhu Houzhao should follow in the footsteps of the Yongle Emperor Zhu Di and launch a new wave of expeditions to cultivate our influence abroad. How are we to decide?"
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTA1:0 "Develop our Southern Capital."

  disasters_and_development.2.d:0 "Originally constructed during the 14th century and finished in its construction in the year 1409 by our previous king Wladyslaw II Jagiello, the Trakai Island Castle played an important strategic role as the temporary capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  The castle saw major devastation during an attack by the Teutonic Knights in 1377, together with the assassination of Kestutis, launched Lithuania right into a state of civil war. Later it was rebuild, and its construction played a decisive role in the Poland-Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Order after the Battle of Grunwald.\n\nWith the region secured and the capital again established in Vilnius, many say, the castle has lost its militaristic importance. How are we to act?"
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTA2:0 "Fit for a summer palace."
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTB2:0 "A luxurious prison for our political prisoners."
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTC2:0 "Pawn it off to some count."
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTD3:0 "My arse! Its walls have just become 10 feet taller."
 disasters_and_development.3.t:0 "Sea Cow Cheese"
  disasters_and_development.3.d:0 "Our former rules has made it illegal exploit the local marine mammals for hunting. Instead, he proposed that we were to domesticate the herd of “Sea Cows” that roam the shores along the Hecate strait. It has been quite the task keeping the animals in one area, especially as their food source, over time, gets depleted. As such, the colonists have begun to start feeding these cows locally grown lettuce to somewhat halt their migration, and to keep them in place when they have calves.\n\nSea cows, unlike land cows, have two teats, one uncer each flipper. But, milking them underwater has proven itself a challenge, and required the invention of a watertight teat-cup. But, alas we’ve managed to extract enough milk to create Sea Cow Cheese.\n\nCheese from the “Steller Sea Cow Ranch” has a smooth, creamy texture with light undertones of seaweed. In most cases blueberries are added to give that unique seaweed-like colouration along the grooves. And, apparently, recently it has been all the rage at our court. With supply not being able to keep up with demand. Though, we doubt it ever will."
   disasters_and_development.EVTOPTA3:0 "Excellent. More of that please."
 disasters_and_development.4.t:0 "Growth of the Grachtengordel"
  disasters_and_development.4.d:0 "Around the 1600s trade, shipbuilding and industry were flourishing in Amsterdam as never before. This attracted new immigrants. People who were persecuted for their religion in their own country found refuge in the Republic. Many of these migrants contributed to the growing affluence of the country.\n\nAll these people needed somewhere to live. Amsterdam still retained its late medieval shape and area, surrounded by a perimeter canal. It was not permitted to build beyond this, although of course some houses were constructed. The city was bursting at the seams; there was no space for more. In 1613, the city launched a series of expansions and renovations, extending its boundary. Three major canals were built around the old city, one after the other. This was the how Amsterdam’s famous ring of canals was formed and how the city acquired its familiar half-moon shape. \n\nAmsterdam owed its wealth in this period above all to its well-organised staple market and its shipping industry. Products from around the world were brought to Amsterdam, packed in the city’s many warehouses, bought and sold on the exchange and eventually sent elsewhere.\n\nThis period also saw an increase in VOC activities and power. And the expansion of the grachtengordel allowed for the establishment of the VOC shipyard on the East-dock."
