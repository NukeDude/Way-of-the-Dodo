  queens_and_harems.1.d:0 "An old custom named Heqin, also known as marriage alliance, referred to the historical practice of Chinese emperors marrying princesses—usually members of minor branches of the royal family—to rulers of neighboring states. In the past, it was often adopted as an appeasement strategy with an enemy state that was too powerful to defeat on the battlefield. The policy was not always effective. It implied an equal diplomatic status between the Chinese emperor and the foreign ruler. As a result, it was controversial and had many critics.\n\nBut, ever since the Le dynasty was established, thus ending our rule over the Annam (Vietnam) region, our relations with our southern neighbours have steadily declined. Aristocrats in these regions have even started abandoning the Buddhist and Taoist texts and scriptures that were of such importance during the reign of the Yongle emperor. As such, some of the opposition have started to suggest we reintroduce Heqin lest our influence decreases even further.\n\nBeware, as our advisors might object."
